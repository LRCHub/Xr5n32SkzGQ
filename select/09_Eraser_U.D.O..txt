You try to take me to the dark side
You try to needle me with pain
You try to cover me with your might
You try to get inside my brain

Crawling around - my feet off the ground
Get out of sight - it's my holy might

Eraser - brainwashing everyone's mind
Eraser - I fight you - I'm one of a kind

Nobody understands your danger
Nobody wants to go that way
Nobody fighting with resistance
No second chance no other day

I am the Nemesis to beat you
I am the one to knock you down
I am the author I'm the savior
The one to put you in the ground
