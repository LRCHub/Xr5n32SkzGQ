I'm just a toy waiting for you to claim me
I want to make, just make you happy
There's no future I see with you in it
I just don't fit, not the right plastic
Oh, I'm not mad, lean on me, man
How many times I gotta listen to your mouth? Go!
How many times? How many times? How many times?
Turn the clocks back to the way things were
I never wanted to be this me (erase, eraser)
Show me back then the kid before the man
I don't think this me is who I am
Oh, middle aged bring me a crisis
What am I worth? Does the truth hurt?
Identity, write the tales of disaster
Ease on the clutch., Who gives a fuck?
Oh, I'm not mad. Lean on me man
Oh, I'm not mad I'm not, I'm not, I'm not
Turn the clocks back to the way things were
I never wanted to be this me (erase, eraser)
Show me back then the kid before the man
I don't think this me is who I am
Ha ha ha!
Turn the clocks back to the way things were
I never wanted to be this, I never wanted to be this
I never wanted to be this me
Turn the clocks back to the way things were
I never wanted to be this me (erase, eraser)
Show me back then the kid before the man
I never wanted to be this
Just, just erase this
I never wanted to be this
Just, just erase me
